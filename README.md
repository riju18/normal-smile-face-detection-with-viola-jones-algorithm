# normal_smile_face_detection_voila_jones_algorithm
 From google: The Viola-Jones algorithm is a widely used mechanism for object detection. The main property of this algorithm is that training is slow, but detection is fast. ... Then the detection window is moved across the image as follows: Set the minimum window size, and sliding step corresponding to that size.
